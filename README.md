# Pizza-sales-Analysis
I have collected the data from Kaggle and understand the data, make some insightful objectives and visualized the cleaned data according to objective.
I used line chart for showing the week day sales;
Column chart for showing sales accoding to region and daily hours;
Pie chart for pupular pizza type;
Donut chart for sales among the customer type and used a slicer for location specific data;
I did all over pivot table by drag and drop on the boxes.
